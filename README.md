# Chat Web:

This project is a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript chat web application that allows users to send and receive messages from other users. The application is designed using the Bootstrap framework, which provides a responsive layout that is compatible with multiple devices and screen sizes.

## HTML

The HTML file consists of two main sections: the chat list and the chat window. The chat list contains a list of users that the user can message, while the chat window displays the messages between the user and the selected user.

## CSS

The CSS file contains the styles for the HTML elements. The file "Display.css" contains the custom styles for the application.

### External Libraries

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - a CSS framework used for creating responsive layouts
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) - a collection of open source icons for use with Bootstrap

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Enter a message in the input field and press enter to send the message to the selected user.
4. To add a new user to the chat list, click on the "Add Contact" icon on the navigation bar and fill out the form.
